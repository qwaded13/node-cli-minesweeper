# Node-CLI-Minesweeper

A text-based Minesweeper CLI game that runs on NodeJS. I built this to practice handling user inputs from the command line with Node as opposed to the browser, which I am more familiar with, as well as designing a JS class for the game itself.

## Getting Started

*This program runs on the latest version of [NodeJS (10.16.0)](https://nodejs.org/en/)*

- Simply run `node minesweeper.js` from the root directory and follow the prompts in the terminal
- Press 'x' at any time to exit the game
